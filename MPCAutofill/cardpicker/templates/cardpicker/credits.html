    <h2>Community Contributions</h2>
    <p>
        This website is only possible because of the contributions of hard-working members of the
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mpcproxies/">MPC Reddit community</a>.
        <br>
        Currently, there are <b>{{ total_count.3 }}</b> images in the database &#8212 comprised of
        <b>{{ total_count.0 }}</b> cards, <b>{{ total_count.1 }}</b> card backs, and <b>{{ total_count.2 }}</b> tokens
        &#8212 from <b>{{ sources.items|length }}</b> contributors. The database is automatically synced with all Drives
        every day (starting at midnight in NYC) to ensure all changes are recorded.
        <br>
        The community Google Drives hooked up to this website, and an overview of their contributions, are included
        below.

        <h3>Contribution Guidelines</h3>
        If you'd like to have your drive added to the site, shoot me a message on
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Chilli_Axe/">Reddit</a>! I'd love to make this website's
        card database as comprehensive as possible. When preparing a drive to be linked with MPC Autofill, please follow
        these guidelines:
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure each image's name matches the card's Oracle name,</li>
            <li>Ensure each image has a file extension,</li>
            <li>When you have multiple versions of a card in the same folder, use parentheses to differentiate them 
                &#8212 e.g. <code>Black Lotus.png</code> and <code>Black Lotus (Masterpiece).png</code>,
            </li>
            <li>Name split cards with an ampersand between the card's names &#8212 e.g. <code>Fire & Ice.png</code>,
            </li>
            <li>Store your token images in a folder called <code>Tokens</code> (anywhere on your drive),</li>
            <li>Store your cardback images in a folder called <code>Cardbacks</code> (anywhere on your drive),</li>
            <li>Prepend the names of any folders you don't want to be indexed by MPC Autofill with <code>!</code> 
                &#8212 e.g. <code>!Misc and Art</code>,</li>
            <li>Limit your files to less than 30 MB per image &#8212 this is the maximum that Google Scripts can return
                in one request, which means that <code>autofill.exe</code> won't work with images larger than this. Due
                to this limitation, images larger than 30 MB will not be indexed,
            </li>
            <li>Please include a link to your Reddit (or other social media) account to list on the site when you request 
                that your Drive is indexed.
            </li>
